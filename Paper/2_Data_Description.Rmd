# DATA DESCRIPTION

Our sample periods include quarterly data from 1970:Q4 to 2017:Q4 across 43 countries. The sample periods were chosen
based on the availability of systemic crisis data and credit to gdp data. The main source of teh data 
comes from the Bank of International Settlement (BIS). The total credit data is measured as percentage of GDP.

Regarding data for dating systemic crises, there is no consensus single source of database. We follow the literature and 
use the crisis dates reported in the European Systemic Risk Board crisis data set (Lo Duca et al. 2017) and
Laeven and Valencia (2018). 

While the credit data is available until 2021:Q3, our systemic crisis data stopped at 2017:Q4. So we will limit our analysis
till 2017:Q4. We will also omit periods of countries with shorter measurement of credit.
