# Comparison with other decomposition methods

<!-- In this section, we check the robustness of our results by comparing the estimated trend-cycle from our approach with univariate trend-cycle decomposition using different methods. In addition to the estimation of the correlation between shocks to the permanent and transitory component, the use of multivariate model in theory should also provide us a  superior measurement of trend and cycle components as compared to the univariate models. To test this hypothesis, we also perform trend-cycle decomposition using the univariate models (Figure \@ref(fig:UKrobust) and \@ref(fig:USrobust)). The univariate models include a HP filter model and a univariate VAR(2) UC model. The HP filter method uses an algorithm to smooth the original data series to estimate the trend component and the difference between them, which is the cyclical component. The parameter value $\lambda$ is set at 1600 as suggested by Hodrick and Prescott for the quarterly data. The univariate UC model only uses a single series of either credit to household or house prices index to decompose a stochastic trend component and a cyclical component with the same specification as in the multivariate UC model.  -->

<!-- The results from Figure \@ref(fig:UKrobust) and Figure \@ref(fig:USrobust) suggest that the estimate of trend and cycles obtained from the multivariate UC model is capable of capturing the dynamics of the two variables during the sample period. The two univariate models, without assuming a linear trend, fail to generate realistic trend and cycle series by ignoring the relationship between the two variables of interest. The HP cycle seems to do very well at remaining stationary, but by doing so, it missed out in capturing the boom of house prices in the US leading to the Great Recession of 2009. The cycle from the univariate UC model, is close to the multivariate counter part but failed to fully indicate the magnitude of boom and bust in house prices in the UK before and after the crisis. Overall, it is clear from the analysis above that there is valuable pay-off in utilising information from extracting permanent and transitory components of credit to household and house prices index in order to study the dynamics of the two variables.  -->
