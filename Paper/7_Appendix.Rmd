<!-- ## Model estimation - Initial values selection {-} -->
<!-- The priors for autoregressive parameters in matrix F are taken from VAR regression of the HP filter cycle decomposition of the series. -->

<!-- For $\beta_{0|0}$, I set $\tau_{0|0}$ as the value HP filtered trend component and omit the first observation from the regression. $c_{0|0}$ cycle components are also set to be equal to their HP filter counterpart. Variance $var(\tau_{0|0}) =100+50*random$; while other measures of the starting covariance are set to be their unconditional values. -->

<!-- Starting standard deviation and correlation values are randomized within reasonable range. -->
