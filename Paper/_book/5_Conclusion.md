# Conclusion

Employing cross effects on the transitory components of the two series allows me to decompose the two variables of credit and housing price into short and long-term components. The models measure the causal effect of past short-term shock from household credit on current housing price and vice versa.

In this paper, the models for US and GB data show that there is a positive relationship between lags of short-term household credit to current house price. 

Further development for this paper should include studying on policy implication of credit and house price gaps with higher magnitude, more robust optimal constraints on parameters to ensure stability rather than an ad-hoc approach to selecting weights. Additional examination of the multicollinearity / identification issue also needs to be addressed.
