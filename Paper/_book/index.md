abstract: 'To overcome model uncertainty in using credit gap as an early warning indicator (EWI) of systemic financial crises in a binary outcome setting, we propose using model averaging of different credit gap measurements to achieve a better averaged model fit and out-of-sample prediction. The methodology we use is logistic binary regression in a panel setup consisting of 40 countries. In this paper, we also propose a novel, superior criteria to judge the performance of an EWI than the one currently popularly used in the literature. Additionally, the empirical results showed that our Bayesian averaged model could synthesize a single credit gap that outperforms any other popularly studied credit gap measurements in terms of an early warning indicator.'
