abstract: 'to overcomes model uncertainty in using credit gap as an early warning indicator (EWI) of systemic financial crises in a binary outcome setting, we propose using model averaging of different credit gap measurements to achieve better averaged model fit and out of sample prediction. The methodologies we use are logistic binary regression in a panel set up consisting of 40 countries. In this paper, we also propose a novel, superior criteria to judge the performance of an EWI than the one currently popularly used in the literature. The empirical results showed that our Bayesian averaged model can synthesize a single credit gap that out-performs any other popularly studied credit gap measurements in term of an early warning indicator.'
